A small member of the Eopsaltriidae family (Australasian Robins) the ngiro ngiro (miromiro in the Noth Island) is a popular denizen of the bush for its habit, like most robins, of seeking people out. 
The bird was nicknamed torotoro (scout) by Maori for its habit of appearing from nowhere in the forest. It was the first to settle on the water troughs with snares attached to them, a scout for the pigeons coming to drink. Then there was its habit of scratching the ground over which an enemy had walked. This was a telltale sign to the warrior looking for footprints of his foe.
In the battle between the land and sea birds in ancient times the Miromiro had a special job too, as torotoro for the land birds, to keep watch on the movements of the enemy. It was considered best suited because of its keen and quick vision, its ability to move rapidly but secretly.
There are several sub-species. The North and South Island sub-species look alike except that the male in the South Island sub species is a lot more yellow in the breast, whereas his North Island cousin is white.

He compared the call to kiwi calls on the internet and is 100% sure it was a kiwi call. It was very distinctive and different to any of the other bird calls he has ever heard. On one occasion a friend who has observed kiwis in person heard the call too and confirmed it was a kiwi. However, we have not seen any footprints or heard any kiwi-like calls since then. However, we have heard that other people further down the valley on our side of the stream also claim to have heard kiwi.

Takanosu 鷹ノ巣山. In the evening a mother with two cubs came up from slopes of the mountain to the wide wooded ridge  where is the hut. The two cubs looked more shy, while the mother was rather nonchalant  about the presence of a human at close distance (50 meters) and went on browsing the ground. Later in the evening and during the night  many more deer came out around the hut, perhaps a dozen. Judging from the many deer footprints along the hiking path and  the number of trees that have been  covered with metal wire for protection against deer, deer is abundant in the woods and on the ridge of this mountain. A hiker told me that they are very common all the way to Mt. Kumotori 雲取山.  The morning after this sighting, on the bottom of the valley, at Kamozawa 鴨沢, at the start of the hiking path of Mt.

Front track:  Width: 10.2 cm (4""),  Length: 10.2 cm (4"")

Rear track:  Width: 8.9 cm (3.5""),  Length: 10.2 cm (4"")

Four oval toes register. The leading edge of the metacarpal pad is bilobate; the posterior edge has three lobes, which are very distinct in these photos. The negative space between the toes and metacarpals forms a ""C"". Nails are not evident in these tracks. Front track is rounder and larger than the rear. 

I could easily follow the tracks for about 100 feet in soft dirt. They were fresh (i.e., not compromised by wind or other footprints). Some of the tracks were on top of horse tracks. There were some deer tracks in this area also. And, surprisingly, very small (2""x2"") feline or canine tracks right beside the big ones (4""x4"").

A lot has been going on in this area!

Not an ideal photo for ID purposes: the goose is tiny in frame , but sharply outlined against the white sand and its footprints are likewise visible ( it took a few steps towards the sea as it became more anxious the nearer I got.
Smart bird- species now fully protected, almost wiped out due hunting for food within first century of European 'settlement' along with predation by introduced foxes cats etc)
Making a pleasing comeback but no room for complacency.
I looked carefully with binoculars for a mate but was unsuccessful.
However a second goose may have been hidden among the rocks to R of visible bird.
I could not get a closer look in case I disrupted  an attempt at breeding here on mainland shoreline( this species' survival is now largely dependant on breeding on offshore islands but pre-settlement  breeding also occurred on parts of southern Australia's mainland coasts)",3,0,false,,"Myponga Beach SA 5202, Australia",-35.40724076,138.3295440674,244,,open,false,,,Cape Barren Goose,Cereopsis novaehollandiae,Cape Barren Goose,Aves,7150

Captured six photos of one Common Raccoon near the entrance of the trail at Frew Mill. The entrance of the trail has the most population going through which means trash which means food for raccoons. 

The tracks measured 2 inches in lengths for the front paws and 3 inches for the hind feet. It seemed that this raccoon was galloping through. These were very fresh and showed very little human footprints. The distance between each track was around a foot in length.

Weather: Temperature during hike was 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Cloudy and grey. Trail conditions had snow and ice from temperatures from the morning. Didn't have any wind from being in a valley. Percent humidity was 30% during that time. 

No other animal tracks were spotted in the nearby vicinity.

This avian has a black bill and black webbed feet to match. The underbelly and neck are white while the wings are gray. The eyes are surrounded by white flesh and the tail has three visible white dots. The head of the avian is covered in gray-black feathers. The visible footprints illustrate three ""toes"" and the webbed portion in between. Comparing this avian to others in the area, it seems as if the gray-black feathers on its head can vary in coloration.

The prints looked like the tracks from an animal: Each print was slightly different (so I don’t think they were made by a person wearing bear-shaped snowshoes.) I followed the tracks for maybe 100  feet. To me, they look like bear prints... but that seems implausible because the photos were taken (by me) in a cemetery in Ann Arbor.

•	Trophic level: Primary, secondary consumer
•	Description: The infamous nocturnal bandit. Typically seen only at night, and easily distinguishable by its relatively large size, ringed tail, and black “mask” around the eyes. Bigger and chunkier than an opossum, plumper and probably slower than a fox. 
•	Life Cycle: Breeding begins in mid-winter, with males roaming their range for females to court. Beyond this, males have no role in raising young and move elsewhere to prevent inbreeding. Around two months later, young are born blind and deaf, and do not emerge from the den until several weeks later. Litters are larger in areas with high mortality. 
•	Stage: Difficult to say, based on the fact that these are footprints. But they are about the size the guide gives, so I would guess this was an adult.
•	Sex: Females are a bit smaller than males, but in the field, this would be tough to tell. Obviously, these tracks tell us nothing.
•	Habitat: Deciduous forests and marshes. Require trees to climb and water to forage for invertebrates. I also see them coming in and out of storm drains sometimes. 
•	Predator: On Long Island, virtually none. Birds of prey like Great Horned Owls could pick off young, though. 
•	Prey: Practically anything they can get their hands on. These tracks were found at a saltwater lagoon, and the culprit may eat critters such as Atlantic Blue Crabs.
