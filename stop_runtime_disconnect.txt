After model is training or script is running,
**Click Ctrl + Shift + i -> go to browser console and enter the following:**


function ConnectButton(){ console.log("Connect pushed"); document.querySelector("#top-toolbar > colab-connect-button").shadowRoot.querySelector("#connect").click() } setInterval(ConnectButton,60000);


**This will click the Colab “manage sessions” button to keep the session from timing out due to inactivity**
