**Trick for keeping Colab from disconnecting during long training runs due to inactivity**
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57113226/how-to-prevent-google-colab-from-disconnecting


After the model is training or a script is running in Google Colab,
**Click Ctrl + Shift + i -> go to the Google Chrome browser console and paste the following:**


function ConnectButton(){ console.log("Connect pushed"); document.querySelector("#top-toolbar > colab-connect-button").shadowRoot.querySelector("#connect").click() } setInterval(ConnectButton,60000);


**This will click the Colab “manage sessions” button every 6 seconds to keep the session from timing out due to inactivity**
