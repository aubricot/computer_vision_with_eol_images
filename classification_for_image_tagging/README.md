# Classification for Image Tagging
Testing different image classification frameworks as a method to automatically generate tags for flowers, image type (map/herbarium sheet/phylogeny/illustration), and image ratings within EOL images. Such tags will improve user experience by enabling search of information not included in metadata and further facilitate use of EOL’s less structured image content.

## Project Structure
* **Flowers**: Pre-trained [MobileNet SSD v2](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/classification/4) and [Inception v3](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/inception_v3/classification/4) models downloaded from [Tensorflow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub) and a custom-built model made from scratch based on advice from the [Tensorflow Image Classification Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification) and [pyimagesearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/12/31/keras-conv2d-and-convolutional-layers/) were trained on the [PlantCLEF 2016 Image dataset](https://www.imageclef.org/lifeclef/2016/plant) (Goeau et al. 2016) to classify images into flower, fruit, stem, branch, entire or leaf. Classifications will be used to generate image tags to improve searchability of EOLv3 images by including phenology information. Because the PlantCLEF 2016 dataset used includes other categories, they will be tested, but accuracy for the flower class is the most important tag to add for users and other classes may be dropped depending on training results. The model and hyperparameter combinations with the best trade-off between speed and accuracy - a custom-built model - was selected and used to generate image tags for a bundle of 20,000 EOL flowering plant images. 

* **Flowers/Fruits**: Pre-trained [MobileNet SSD v2](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/classification/4) and [Inception v3](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/inception_v3/classification/4) models downloaded from [Tensorflow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub) were trained on EOL Angiosperm images (evenly distributed across taxonomic groups) to classify images into flower/fruit or not flower/fruit. Classifications will be used to generate image tags to improve searchability of EOLv3 images by including phenology information. The model and hyperparameter combinations with the best trade-off between speed and accuracy - MobileNet SSD v2 training attempts 7 and 11 - were selected and used to generate image tags for a bundle of 20,000 EOL flowering plant images. For test images, training attempt 7 performed better at identifying reproductive structures (flower/fruit) and attemt 11 performed better at identifying images without reproductive structures. Confidence thresholds to maximize coverage and minimize error for both model's predictions were used to post-process and filter classification results and produce final tags.

* **Image Type**: Pre-trained [MobileNet SSD v2](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/classification/4) and [Inception v3](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/inception_v3/classification/4) models downloaded from [Tensorflow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub) were trained on EOL, Wikimedia Commons, and Flicker BHL images to classify EOL images as a map, phylogeny, illustration, herbarium sheet, or none. The model and hyperparameter combinations with the best trade-off between speed and accuracy - MobileNet SSD v2 training attempt 13 - was selected and used to generate image tags for a bundle of 20,000 EOL images. Images are pre-processed to add photographic or non-photographic tags using a "cartoonization" image processing approach. Then image tags are added using image classification with MobileNet SSD v2. Image type tags will further improve search functionality for users, allowing the sorting of EOL images to include or exclude desired classes.

* **Image Ratings**: [to be developed following an initial research phase on existing models and datasets] Pre-trained and custom-built models will be trained on a to be determined dataset (possibly from an existing EOL user-generated image quality ratings dataset) and used to classify EOL images into quality rating categories 1-5 (best to worst). In addition to previous EOL object detection for image thumbnail cropping efforts, this will further improve EOL gallery displays and functionality for API users, allowing the selection of only the best-rated images to be displayed or retrieved instead of a pool of mixed quality. 

Results from image classification models used for the different tasks can be used to inform future large-scale image processing and user features for EOLv3 images.

## Getting Started  
Except preprocessing.py files (plantclef_preprocessing.py, tbd_preprocessing.py), all files in this repository are run in [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) (Google Colaboratory, "a free cloud service, based on Jupyter Notebooks for machine-learning education and research"). Using Colab, everything is run entirely in the cloud (and can link to Google Drive) and no local software or library installs are requried.   

For additional details on steps below, see the [project wiki](https://github.com/aubricot/computer_vision_with_eol_images/wiki).

## Flowers
**Step 1) Pre-process training data locally and upload to Google Drive:** Download the [PlantCLEF 2016 Image dataset](https://www.imageclef.org/lifeclef/2016/plant) locally. Then run [plantclef_preprocessing.py](https://github.com/aubricot/computer_vision_with_eol_images/blob/master/classification_for_image_tagging/flowers/plantclef_preprocessing.py) to randomly select 6,000 images and sort them into folders based on image classes contained within metadata of the training dataset xmls (flower, fruit, entire, stem, leaf, branch). After running plantclef_preprocessing.py, zip the folder containing all image class subfolders. Upload the zipped folder to Google Drive (uploading the zipped folder will save time, because uploading to Drive can be slow) and unzip before running the notebook in Step 2 (use a command like this in a Colab notebook: !unzip images.zip -d images).

**Step 2) Build & train classification models:** After preparing the training dataset locally and uploading it to Google Drive in Step 1, build and train classification models by clicking here [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aubricot/computer_vision_with_eol_images/blob/master/classification_for_image_tagging/flowers/flowers_train.ipynb). Form fields and dropdown menus within the notebook walk you through model selection, adjusting hyperparameters, training, and the display of trained models.

**Step 3) Display classification results on images:** To display classification results from Step 2 on images and verify that they are as expected (or to further fine tune the classification model accordingly, ex: adjust hyperparameters from drop-down menus and re-train), click here [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aubricot/computer_vision_with_eol_images/blob/master/classification_for_image_tagging/flowers/classification_display_test.ipynb).

## Flowers/Fruits
**Step 1) Pre-process training data in Google Drive:** Click here [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aubricot/computer_vision_with_eol_images/blob/master/classification_for_image_tagging/flower_fruit/flower_fruit_preprocessing.ipynb) to download images from  EOL Angiosperm "max 30 images per family" bundle to Google Drive. Manually sort images into flower, fruit, null (no flowers or fruits), and other (images to be excluded that don't fit cleanly into oather categories) folders. Then, return to notebook to inspect the number of images per folder and training class. The number of training images per class should be even, so the folder with the fewest images (fruit) is used as is. Other folders (flower, null) are archived and zipped before trimming the number of images contained to be even across all training folders.

**Step 2) Build & train classification models:** After pre-processing the training dataset in Step 1, build and train classification models by clicking here [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aubricot/computer_vision_with_eol_images/blob/master/classification_for_image_tagging/flower_fruit/flower_fruit_train.ipynb). Form fields and dropdown menus within the notebook walk you through model selection, adjusting hyperparameters, training, and the display of trained models. Choose the N-best training attempts/models before moving to Step 3.

**Step 3) Determine model prediction confidence thresholds to use for classification:** Click here [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aubricot/computer_vision_with_eol_images/blob/master/classification_for_image_tagging/flower_fruit/det_conf_threshold.ipynb) to review false and positive detections by class for attempts/models chosen in Step 2. Choose which trained model and confidence threshold values to use for classifying flowers/fruits from EOL images. Threshold values should be chosen that maximize coverage and minimize error.

**Step 4) Classify images, post-process results, and display outcomes:** To classify images, click here [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aubricot/computer_vision_with_eol_images/blob/master/classification_for_image_tagging/flower_fruit/classify_images.ipynb).
Run images through classification models selected in Step 2. Then post-process results using confidence values chosen in Step 3. Display final classification tags on images and verify that they are as expected (or further fine tune confidence thresholds).

**Step 1) Pre-process training data in Google Drive:** Click here [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aubricot/computer_vision_with_eol_images/blob/master/classification_for_image_tagging/image_type/image_type_preprocessing.ipynb) to download images from  EOL Angiosperm "max 30 images per family" bundle to Google Drive. Manually sort images into flower, fruit, null (no flowers or fruits), and other (images to be excluded that don't fit cleanly into oather categories) folders. Then, return to notebook to inspect the number of images per folder and training class.

Form fields and dropdown menus within the notebook walk you through model selection, adjusting hyperparameters, training, and the display of trained models. Choose the N-best training attempts/models before moving to Step 3.

**Step 3) Determine model prediction confidence thresholds to use for classification:** Click here [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aubricot/computer_vision_with_eol_images/blob/master/classification_for_image_tagging/image_type/inspect_train_results.ipynb) to review false and positive detections by class for attempts/models chosen in Step 2. Choose which trained model and confidence threshold values to use for classifying flowers/fruits from EOL images. Threshold values should be chosen that maximize coverage and minimize error. 

**Step 4) Determine cartoonization values to use for classifying images as photographic or non-photographic:** Click here [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aubricot/computer_vision_with_eol_images/blob/master/classification_for_image_tagging/image_type/cartoonify_images.ipynb) to determine cartoonization values for the training dataset. Images are "caroonified", then the change in color values is compared. If change above a certain threshold, then it is likely a photographic image. If change below a certain threshold, it is likely a non-photographic image (cartoon). Manhattan norm, Manhattan norm per pixel, Zero norm, and Zero norm per pixel are shown. Threshold values should be chosen that clearly distinguish the two categories for the training dataset. 

**Step 5) Cartoonize images, Classify images, post-process tags, and display results:** To classify images, click here [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aubricot/computer_vision_with_eol_images/blob/master/classification_for_image_tagging/image_type/classify_images.ipynb).
Run images through cartoonization and classification pipelines. Then post-process results using confidence values chosen in Step 3 and cartoonization values chosen in Step 4. Display final classification tags on images and verify that they are as expected (or further fine tune thresholds).
